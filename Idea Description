#Our group plan to create a gambling simulator using the game of blackjack as the only way to earning or losing money.
#In Our project we will use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for interactions between card objects, player objects, money objects, etc.
#We will need a system method to interact with the hand object to determine the winner, a dealer method to interact with the cards objects/list and randomly pass out two cards to the players.
#Lastly, we will create a method that will take in the amount of money objects and saves it in a variable that stores the total money amount. In terms of servers, we need to establish a credential method to verify users and fetch the correct money object/list.
#We also need that method to fetch the correct player object so it saves the userâ€™s progress.
